A triversi game you can play with your friends, coded in C.

# What is Triversi?
Triversi is a three player version of Reversi (Tri-riversi). Similar to the traditional two player Reversi, you flip the opponent's pieces by sandwiching them with your own color pieces. However, unlike the traditional Reversi with black and white pieces, this version uses red, blue, and yellow pieces.
